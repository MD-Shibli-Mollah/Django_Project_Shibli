# Django_Project_Shibli
I am going to create a chat bot and then deploy it to the web. This project is all about installing and finalizing it.
Installing:
python --version


Install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper
virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper provide a dedicated environment for each Django project you create. While not mandatory, this is considered a best practice and will save you time in the future when you’re ready to deploy your project. Simply type:

pip install virtualenvwrapper-win
Then create a virtual environment for your project:

mkvirtualenv myproject
The virtual environment will be activated automatically and you’ll see “(myproject)” next to the command prompt to designate that. If you start a new command prompt, you’ll need to activate the environment again using:

workon myproject
